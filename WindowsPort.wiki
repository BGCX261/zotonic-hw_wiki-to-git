WindowsIssues#summary Issues with running Zotonic on windows.

Fixed issues:
 * No "file" command on windows; used internal extension-to-mime.
 * Escaping of filenames and command options was different on unix and windows.

Open issues:
 * Conversion of path names in commands and templates; it still complains sometimes over missing files.
 * Dates before 1970 go wrong in erlang:localtime_to_universaltime


Installation requirements:
 * Erlang (tested with R13B03)
 * Postgresql (tested with 8.4)
 * OpenSSL installer + VC2008 redist
 * Imagemagick
